*Visible project processes - 0,33pts;<br/>
*Lead engineer/ engineer manager - 0,33pts;<br/><br/>
Level 2 - Managed: <br/>
*Healthy sonar metrics - 0,25pts;<br/>
*Healthy lead engineer/engineer manager proportion (1 lead by <=7 developers) - 0,25pts;<br/>
*DB1 best practices for software development (100%) - 0,25pts; <br/>
*Automated pipelines (CI/CD) dor projects (>=80%) - 0,25pts. <br/><br/>
Level 3 - Optimal: <br/>
In addition to DB1's recommendations, the team improves the process by creating new practices that improve the quality of the developed software.

To assign the score in the indicator, perform the sum of the items that the project meets. For a project to be performing at a level it must have ALL points met. If one of the points is not met, it will be understood in the scale, as the previous level. However, breaking items helps us see progress.
