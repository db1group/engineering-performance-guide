    *How many developers under your leadership?<br/>
    *Are you aware of the client's strategic objectives?<br/>
    *Were the architectural drawings used updated in the last quarter?<br/>
    *Are there Code Review processes?<br/>
    *Is there a versioning strategy?<br/>
    *Does your team follow the language code style ?<br/>
    *Are there records of technical agreements?<br/>
    *What is the percentage of projects in which you operate that have CI?<br/>
    *What is the percentage of projects in which you operate that have CD?<br/><br/>
    Each correct answer adds points that give the percentage of adherence to the db1 recommendations. All questions have the same weight
